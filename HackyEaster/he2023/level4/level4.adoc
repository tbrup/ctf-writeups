= [HE23.10] Flip Flop

image::level4/challenge10.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
This awesome service can flipflop an image!

Flag is located at: /flag.txt

http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2310

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.


== Solution
I got a very direct hint from another participant, that CVE-2022-44268 might
help.  Some googling leads to a proof of concept exploit at
https://github.com/kljunowsky/CVE-2022-44268.

Using this script to generate a poisoned png to read ``/flag.txt`` and
uploading it, gives us another file back with the contents of the file
embedded in the raw profile type.  We find
``6865323032337b316d3467332d7472346731634b2d6167613131316e7d`` that
translates to ``he2023{1m4g3-tr4g1cK-aga111n}``.

= [HE23.11] Bouncy Not In The Castle

image::level4/challenge11.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro

Very bouncy, indeed, but not in a castle.

    Try http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2308

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

== Solution
The web-site shows a landscape (a park) with many easter eggs bouncing up and
down.  Looking at the JS code running the spage, we find a suspiciously large,
constant array.  This array has a size of 6 * 21 * 21 characters, or probably
an array of 21 by 21 colours.  With a short program we can unpack the values to
create a png to play around.  Using `stegsolve` we can then identify the blue
channel as carrying the QR-code with the flag:

image::level4/flag11.png[,100,]
image::level4/flag11_bw.png[,125,]

Flag: `he2023{n0_b0uNc}`

= [HE23.12] A Mysterious Parchment

image::level4/challenge12.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro

On their holiday, the bunnies came across a sleepy village with an interesting
tower. While enjoying the view, one of them found a crumpled parchment in a
corner. "Hah, that's clever!", the bunnies agreed after quickly solving the
code and altered it ever so slightly.

=== ðŸš© Flag

- uppercase only, no spaces
- wrap into he2023{ and }
- example: he2023{EXAMPLEFLAGONLY}

=== Hints
* Who is Dagobert II and why isn't he here?
* No cryptography is needed here - just need to look at the right thing!

== Solution
The picture shows the "Tour Magdala", the exile of Dagobert II, a king of the
Frank.  A google search finds the original and it has been slightly altered in
that some letters are raised a bit from the line.  Reading them off gives the
flag ``he2023{BUTISITACOOLOLDCODEITSUREIS}``


= [HE23.13] Hamster

== Intro
The Hamster has a flag for you.

=== Hints
`curl` is your friend

= [HE23.14] Lost in (French) Space

image::level4/challenge14.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
My friend went to France and sent me coordinates of interesting things he found.

Three of them look legit, but one does not make sense to me.

    48.998 2.008
    45.960 0.090
    43.579 1.524
    45.007 4.335

ðŸš© Flag

* the *first word* of the thing you find
* six *lowercase* letters
* wrapped in flag format, e.g. `he2023{thingy}`

The three legitimate coordinates will lead you to the fourth.

== Solution
Looking at the co-ordinates shows us three locations in France (always assume N
and E):

* Parc aux Ã©toiles (park of the stars) an observatory in Paris
* le sentier des planÃ¨tes (the path of the planets)
* the Mars observatory

The fourth location is just an empty field.

After a lot of pondering and grasping at straws, the train of thought stars -->
planets --> Mars, so the fourth co-ordinate could be on mars.  Luckily Google
maps are usable for Mars!

https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars/@45.977834,0.0802512,114715m/data=!3m1!1e3

This shows us the Davies crater, so the flag is `he2023{davies}`



= [HE23.15] Spy Tricks

image::level4/challenge15.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro


The bunny spymaster found a tiny note in a forgotten dead drop and is now
scratching her head; she's sure she once knew the code, but there are too many
swirling aorund in her head right now. Can you help her decipher the message?

=== Hints
  Looks like these numbers have something in common!


== Solution
The message consists of numbers that all have 313 as greatest common divisor.
Reducing them by this factor gives ASCII codes that spell the flag.
