= [HE23.16] Thumper's PWN - Ring 3

image::level5/challenge16.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro

Thumper has been hunting his nemesis, Dr. Evil, for months. He
finally located his remote system and is trying to gain access.
Can you help him find the right password?

Target: nc ch.hackyeaster.com 2313

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

== Solution
Dr. Evil's application is vulnerable to format string injections.  After some probing we get a password:

  $ nc ch.hackyeaster.com 2313
  Welcome to the password protected vault
  Please enter your password: %p %p %s %p %p %s %s
  Nope..
  0x7f1d8ec437e3 0x7f1d8ec448c0 H= 0x6 0x7f1d8ee6c4c0 (null) 5uP3R_s3cUr3_PW
  
  is incorrect. Better luck next time

So ```` is the password to get in and we get the flag

  Welcome to the password protected vault
  Please enter your password: 5uP3R_s3cUr3_PW
  Access granted, here is your flag:
  
  he2023{w3lc0m3_t0_r1ng_3_thump3r}

Connect to the server, snoop around, and find the flag!

    ssh ch.hackyeaster.com -p 2306 -l blinky
    password is: blinkblink

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

== Solution
Logging into the system we get a shell, but it seems to be not behaving nicely.  Somebody has added many aliases to trick us, check out `` /etc/profile.d/alias.sh`` for all aliases and unalias them.  Now we can look around the system without having to prepend every command with a ``\``.

In ``/home/blinky/`` we find a file ``blinkyflag.fzip``, a password protected zip file.

For a long time the password was sought.  Finally the aliases set in ``/etc/profile.d/aliases.sh`` provided the solution:

  alias fzip='/usr/bin/zip -P "/bin/funzip"'

``/bin/funzip`` is the password...

  $ funzip home/blinky/blinkyflag.fzip
  Enter password:
  he2023{al1asses-4-fUn-and-pr0fit}

= [HE23.18] Going Round

image::level5/challenge18.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
I got a flag, but it's encrypted somehow:

  ip0232j{1t_x_v0z4b3bm__v4xvq}a

It was created using the following service:

http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2305

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

== Solution

The service gives us a simple means to encrypt, _e.g._ http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2305/encrypt?s=sample returns the value eatuit.  Some playing around shows:

* characters are flipped pairwise ("aa" always becomes "ei" if it is on an even index into the string)
* only lower case characters are affected, other characters are just swapped
* the distance between swapped and ecrypted characters is constant

This gives the possibility to write a short program to reverse the encryption:

[source, python]
----
SHIFT1 = 8
SHIFT2 = 4

msg = 'ip0232j{1t_x_v0z4b3bm__v4xvq}a'

def rotate(c, r):
    tmp = ord(c) + r
    if tmp > ord('z'):
        return chr(tmp-26)
    elif tmp < ord('a'):
        return chr(tmp+26)
    else:
        return chr(tmp)

def encode(s):
    res = ''
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        p = s[i:i+2]
        print(p)
        res += rotate(p[1], SHIFT2) if p[1].islower() else p[1]
        res += rotate(p[0], SHIFT1) if p[0].islower() else p[0]
    return res

def decode(s):
    res = ''
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        p = s[i:i+2]
        print(p)
        res += rotate(p[1], -SHIFT1) if p[1].islower() else p[1]
        res += rotate(p[0], -SHIFT2) if p[0].islower() else p[0]
    return res


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(decode(msg))

The flag is ``he2023{fl1p_n_r0t4t3_in_p4irs}``

= [HE23.19] Numbers Station

image::level5/challenge19.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
"Testing, testing, one, two, one, zero.." - the bunnies found a strange radio
station when looking for uplifting BunnyBop; can you find out what the nice
Spanish lady is saying?

file ``numbers.mp3``

=== Hint
There are 10 kinds of people in this world.

Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

== Solution
The mp3 is an 8-minute recording of a numbers station.  This can be transcribed using an on-line service, I used Microsoft's Office 365.  Some post editing was needed...

Analising the occurrences of the different digits, we notice that 0 and 1 are represented much more often that the other digits.  So extract these and interpret them as binary numbers; since the first two correspond to ``h`` and ``e`` it is pretty clear that we are on the right track.  Make it nice and print the flag:

= [HE23.20] Igor's Gory Passwordsafe

image::level5/challenge20.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
You found the following letter:

__Hi Peter

Thanks again for your help in cryptography to make the passwordsafe secure. Now

* The passwords of the user are stored in a irreversible way (bcrypt)
* All passwords in the safe are encrypted by a strong symmetric key

Kind regards, Roy__

Open the passwordsafe at at http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2312 to get your ðŸš© flag.

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

=== Hint
No brute forcing needed, really!

== Solution
The password safe has a very simple interface: you can sign up, then login
and start using the password safe.  Add a password, show it and get the
password.  To get the password, a simple GET request is used with the ID of
the password: http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2312/get/13 will get you the password
with ID 13.  What happens when we try some IDs?  

We're lucky and the ID 7 gives back ``he2023{1d0R_c4n_d3str0y_ur_Crypt0_3ff0rt}``

This one can be solved with linux commands, with a one-liner.

The zip file contains a single text file with about 100k lines of the form ``he2023{xcvxcv_xcvxcv_xcvxcv_xvxcvxvc}```.
