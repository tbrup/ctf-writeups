= [HE23.03] Rotation

image::level2/challenge3.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro

My new rotor messed up the flag!

  96a_abL_?b04c?0Cbc50C_E_C03c4<HcC5DN

I tried to decode it, but it didn't work. The rotor must have been too fast!

== Solution

Rotor hints at a rotation cipher, so head over to cyber Chef and try some.
Since ``ord('h')-ord('9') == 47`` it can be ROT47, and yes it creates the
flag  ``he2023{0n3_c4n_r34d_r0t0r_b4ckw4rds}``

= [HE23.04] Birds on a Wire

image::level2/challenge4.jpg[,300,float="right"]

Just some birds sitting on a wire.

Download the image and find the flag!

image::level2/birdsonawire.jpg[,600]

=== ðŸš© Flag

-   lowercase only, no spaces
-   wrap into he2023{ and }
-   example: he2023{exampleflagonly}

== Solution

There is a cypher called birds on a wire.

Use https://www.dcode.fr/birds-on-a-wire-cipher to get the Solution
``he2023{birdwatchingisfun}``

= [HE23.05] Bins

image::level2/challenge5.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
The rabbits left a mess in their cage.

````
  //    //                    //

 /rr   /rr       carrots      /rr   
*\))_ *\))_                  *\))_     
````

If only I knew which *bin* to put the rubbish in.
Just some birds sitting on a wire.

=== Hint

Don't try to interpret or decode the strings.

You just need to find the right place.

== Solution
After a lot of banging the head to the wall, the epiphany arrived while taking a rest: pastebin!!

Go to https://pastebin.com/LX2gkn81, enter ``carrots`` as password to get the flag ``he2023{s0rting_th3_w4ste}``.
