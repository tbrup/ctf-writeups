= [HE22.36] Back to the Roots

== Intro
Reversing is considered hard so we thought some old school stuff might be a
gentle start?

This one is only for a simple 8 Bit, 16 MHz and 2KB RAM machine, so how hard
can it be?

Remember: there is always a hard and a simple way.... choose your path!

=== Hint
No hardware is needed for this challenge - though it might be helpful.

== Solution

Inspect the binary first:

* atmega328p
* `openssl aes-128-ecb -d -in secret.txt.enc`
* rockyou.txt
* Arduino

Since I had an Arduino board lying around, load the binary onto it and run it.
It prints a message to the serial port `Give me your best shot!` and then
sits and waits.  Inspecting the binary in Ghidra a bit more, we see that three
buttons are checked (button2, button4, button3).  Shorting pin 2 triggers a
counter that ends in `Flag wiped...`.  

Shorting the pins 2, 4, and 3 in short succession prints the flag
`he2022{0ld_Sko0l_CPu$_st1ll_r0cK!}`.

I guess that this was the easy way...
