== Intro
Egg or chicken, what was first?

`nc 46.101.107.117 2208`

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

File: `eggo.zip`

=== Hint
unlink

== Solution

The zip-file contains an executable and a copy of the `libc`.  Inspect the
binary first with Ghidra and notice:

* Linux application
* allocation of memory for the eggs happens in one function, but the
	content of the egg is entered in another function with `gets`.
* there is an error in the program to keep track of the number of eggs --
	it is never reset
* when the appropriate egg is to be selected, then the input is only
	checked for an upper bound, negative eggs are allowed.
* the hint `unlink` points towards a heap exploit

First a heap based exploit was tried using pwntools, but led nowhere.
Then Engy pointed out that the eggs could be negative and so a direct
manipulation of all memory becomes possible.  The attack in the end works like
this:


. try to find a way to write to the GOT to redirect a function to leak
	addresses from `libc`.  The egg at index -1855 does this, it
	points to `got["strlen"]`.  `strlen` is called as part of
	the weigh function.
. redirect `strlen` to call `printf` instead.  Every call of
	`weigh_egg` now prints the content of the egg pointed to.
. leak the addresses of `printf` and `malloc`.  In priciple one
	would be enough, but having both gives a check that we are really
	dealing with the `libc` provided.
. now that we know the real addresses, we can have `strlen` point to a
	gadget.  The gadgets can be found using "one_gadget" 
	(https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget).  There are
	actually three possibilites.
. redirect `strlen` to one of the gadgets and weigh the egg.  If we
	get a SIGSEV, try the next one, otherwise enjoy the gadget and use the
	shell.


In the end the last gadget worked and we can list the remote directory, find a
file called `eggo.flag` with the flag
`he2022{wh4t_w4s_f1rst_th3_ch1ck3n_0r_th3_3gg?}`.
