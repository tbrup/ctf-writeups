== Intro
I'm looking for a friend of mine who had to flee from his evil owner.

He must have found a shelter for wildlife, but didn't tell me where it is. He
just said he would go join rabbits with hats. What the heck do these three
words mean??

=== ðŸš©Flag

* `he2022{nameoftheplace}`
* *all lowercase, no spaces*
* first letter is j, last one is y
* e.g. `he2022{junglezooaviary}`

=== Hint

* the number of words is important
* search the nearby area

== Solution
Do a goole search for `three words rabbits with hats` and it points you
to a map location and if you zoom out, there is the "Jackrabbit Flat Wildlife
Sanctuary" nearby.  So the flag is
`he2022{he2022{jackrabbitflatwildlifesanctuary}`:
