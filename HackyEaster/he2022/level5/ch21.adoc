== Intro
I've got the source code and the output of a simple cipher.

Can you calculate the flag from it?

File `textbook.zip`.

=== Hint

As usual, the flag starts with `he2022`.

== Solution
The code generator is very simple, each character in the flag is coded as
`pow(ord(c), e, n)` -- take the ASCII value of the character to the power
_e_ and then store the modulo _n_.  Since we have a crib (`he2022` and know
the exponent, we can also calculate the real value of `pow(ord(c),e)`.
Subtract the coded value, we get a number that is known to be a multiple of
_n_, so taking two such numbers, we can calculate _n_ as the GCD of the two
numbers.  Once _n_ is known, we can calculate a rainbow table for all printable
characters and look-up the flag from the encrypted flag:

[source,python]
----
import math

def multi_n(c, cr):
    tmp = pow(ord(c), e)
    return (tmp - cr)


with open('output','r') as inF:
    s = inF.read()[1:-2]
    crypt = [int(x) for x in s.split(', ')]

n = math.gcd(multi_n(crib[0], crypt[0]),
            multi_n(crib[1], crypt[1]))

rainbow = {}
for i in range(32,128):
    rainbow[pow(i,e,n)] = chr(i)

res = ''
for i in crypt:
    res += rainbow[i]

print(res)
----

Flag `he2022{!!t3xtb00k_crypt0!!}`.
