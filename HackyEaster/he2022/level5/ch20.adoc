== Intro
Coney Island Hackers have a secret web portal.

Using advanced social engineering techniques, you found out their secret
passphrase: `eat,sleep,hack,repeat`. However, it seems to take more than just
entering the passphrase as-is. Can you find out what?

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

=== Hint

`if (req.query.passphrase == 'eat,sleep,hack,repeat')`

== Solution

When the leaked password is entered, a message `DANGER, commas detected` is
presented.  So the task is to bypass the detection of commas in the password.
The hint given indicates that the use of the equality operator `==` is the
problem here.  Reading up on the conversion rules if the two objects to be
compared do not have the same type, we find that an array of strings will be
converted to a comma separated string.

To create an array as part of the request,
`?passphrase[0]=eat&passphrase[1]=sleep,...` can be used.  When properly
HTMLized, we get the flag `he2022{el_dorado_arkade}`.
