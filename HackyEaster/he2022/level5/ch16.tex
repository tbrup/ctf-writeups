\section{Intro}
I'm looking for a friend of mine who had to flee from his evil owner.

He must have found a shelter for wildlife, but didn't tell me where it is. He
just said he would go join rabbits with hats. What the heck do these three
words mean??

\noindent{\NotoEmoji ðŸš©} Flag
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+he2022{nameoftheplace}+
\item \textbf{all lowercase, no spaces}
\item first letter is j, last one is y
\item e.g. \verb+he2022{junglezooaviary}+
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hint}
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of words is important
\item search the nearby area
\end{itemize}    

\section{Solution}\label{hv22.16solution}

to a map location and if you zoom out, there is the ``Jackrabbit Flat Wildlife
Sanctuary'' nearby.  So the flag is
\verb+he2022{he2022{jackrabbitflatwildlifesanctuary}+:
