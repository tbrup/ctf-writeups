== Intro
Someone said there would be cake.
`hackyeaster/layercake:latest`


=== Hint
Docker Hub

== Solution

As per the hint, the input is a docker image.  Looking at it in Docker Desktop,
we see that it has many layers and in each a file
`app/egg.png` should be present.  Probably one of them is the flag.

Save the docker image to a tar file with 
`docker save -o container.tar hackyeaster/layercake` and extract it.  This
generates many directories, but each contains a file `layer.tar` that
contains all the data for this layer.  So all we have to do is to extract all
the `layer.tar` and look all `egg.png` files.  A little script helps

[source, python]
----
import tarfile
import glob
import os
import os.path

index = 0
for f in glob.glob('*/layer.tar'):
    tf = tarfile.open(f)
    tf.extractall('.')
    tf.close()
    if os.path.exists('app/egg.png'):
        os.rename('app/egg.png', f'app/egg_{index}.png')
    index += 1
----

Amongst the files are many that are broken eggs, but one contains the flag `he2022{th3_c4k3_is_a_l1e!}`.
