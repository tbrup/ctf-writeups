== Intro
Wanna try your luck in our new casino?

To prove we're not cheating, we are publishing our source code.

=== Hint
The casino is run by the NSA and they have made sure that they can always win.

_P_ and _Q_ are related somehow.

== Solution

The file given shows the casino code that makes use of an elliptic curve pseudo
random number generator to "roll the dice".  When these generators were
standardized by NIST, some flaws were identified quickly -- namely that if the
two constants _P_ and _Q_ are related, then the internal state of the rng can
be obtained from observing a series of outputs.   There is ample literature on
the topic, _e.g._ "How the Dual EC DRBG Backdoor Works" at
http://bugcharmer.blogspot.com/2014/03/how-dual-ec-drbg-backdoor-works.html.
The crucial part of the code is

class RNG:
    def __init__(self):
        p = 115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853951
        b = 0x5ac635d8aa3a93e7b3ebbd55769886bc651d06b0cc53b0f63bce3c3e27d2604b
        self.curve = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [-3,b])

        self.P = self.curve.lift_x(15957832354939571418537618117378383777560216674381177964707415375932803624163)
        self.Q = self.curve.lift_x(66579344068745538488594410918533596972988648549966873409328261501470196728491)
        
        self.state = randint(1, 2**256)
        
    def next(self):
        r = (self.state * self.P)[0].lift()
        self.state = (r * self.P)[0].lift()
        return (r * self.Q)[0].lift() >> 8
----

The rng is standard, except that even more of the result _R Q_ is leaked
than in the NIST proposal.  The first step is to find if _P_ and _Q_ are
related; a simple brute forcing finds that _P = 1337 Q_ and from this it
follows that given the result _R Q_ (the output of the rng), _R P_ can be
calculated as _1337 R Q_, which is almost the internal state of the rng.

Entering the casino, we are greeted with a friendly message that gives us the first _R Q_ shifted right by eight bits

From the true value _R Q_, only eight bits have been destroyed and so we can
build up a collection of 256 possible _R Q_, calculate _R P_ and derive the
internal state for the corresponding rng.  Then start betting and observe which
rngs predict the outcome correctly until only one rng is left.  Now we have the
state identified correctly and can predict the outcome of all future rolls.
Start betting until we have enough money to buy the flag.  To decrypt the flag
we have again to know the rng, but this is straigtforward and can be
implemented in sage:

Compared to the server code, the only difference is that the RNG can be
instantiated with an explicit state, not a random state.  Then the script runs
to completion and prints the flag.
