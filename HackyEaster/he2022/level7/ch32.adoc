== Intro
Go for Gold!

File: `gold.zip`


== Solution

The file given is a Linux executable, written in go and not very ammenable to
reverse engineering the source code using Ghidra.  It becomes clear that

* a password of length 28 is expected
* a mixing stage is used (maschadar).  Here, we have a simple shuffling.
* a replacement stage is used (remplazzar).  In this stage some parts of the
  input are changed in place.
* finally the result is compared with a constant string
* if it matches, the original code is the flag, sandwiched between `he2022{`
  and `}`


After many hours trying to reconstruct the go code, simple breakpoints in gdb
lead to the solution:

* Using a breakpoint before the return of `maschadar` and an input of
 `abcedfghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01` yielded the result of the function as
 `ghbcanopqrstuvwxyz01defijklm`.  This is a simple shuffling of the input and
 can be re-created as a map.  More importantly, it can also be reversed.
* Using the same technique, the output of `remplazzar` can be obtained. The
 ASCII codes for the are changed, and from a known input, the differences can
 be calculated.  Again, this function can be inverted.
* Finally, the target string in `verifigtar` can also be obtained.


The addresses of the break points can be obtained from Ghidra, and so with all
these information we can write a short python script to print the flag
`he2022{hewhohasthegoldmakestherules}`
