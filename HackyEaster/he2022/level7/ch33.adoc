== Intro

Later that year, I was travelling again. Find out where I shot this picture!
This time, I want GPS coordinates.

=== ðŸš©Flag
* GPS coordinates, rounded to three decimals
*  , as separator
*  . as decimal point
*  example:
**  40Â°46'30.3"N 73Â°57'59.8"W
**  40.775082, -73.966599
**  `he2022{40.775,-73.967}`

== Solution

image::level7/street_sign.png[,300,float="right"]

We are given a photograph of a street corner.  Some things come out at once:

* the photo is taken in an English-speaking area
* the license plates on the cars look European and not North American
* the cars seem to drive on the left side of the road
* there are tram-lines and a street sign indicating a speed limit for trams
	of 20mph
* there are two signs on a dilapedated building "for sale" and "to let"
	with telephone numbers showing an area code for Greater Manchester

All of these clues indicate that the street corner sought is somewhere in
Manchester, UK.  Check google maps in 2D mode where the tramlines are indicated
on the map and do a visual search for a place that looks like what we expect to
find from the photograph (tramlines on the street and on a slight corner), take
a look at the street view to verify, and we find the co-ordinates to get the
flag: `he2022{53.482,-2.216}`
