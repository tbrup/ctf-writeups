== Intro
*Apollo* wants his name printed on that fancy new site. He's constantly failing
as vowels and some special characters are blocked when entered.

Can you help him?

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

=== Hint
Submit `"` and see what happens.

== Solution

Using the hint, we find out that the server is running php.  Playing around
with the hints at swissky 
(https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Command%20Injection#bypass-characters-filter-via-hex-encoding)
we see that we can bypass the detection of vowels using hex escapes.
Submitting `\x41p\x6fll\x6f` (encoded for Apollo) greets us with the flag.
