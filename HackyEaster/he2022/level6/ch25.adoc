=== Hint
継承 -- inheritance

== Solution

First translate all the labels from Japanese to English

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| 継承
| Inheritance 

| あなたの選択をしてください! 
| Make your choice! 

| 自動販売機 
| vending machine 

| お楽しみください🧃! 
| Enjoy 🧃!

Playing around with Postman triggers these messages:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|順序が無効です
|The order is invalid 

|金額は1から4の間でなければなりません
|The amount must be between 1 and 4 

|アイテムが見つかりません
|Item not found 

|🚩は許可されていません
|🚩is not allowed 
|===

The application simulates a vending machine that offers several different
items, but does reject the flag  🚩.  Very likely we have to try to get the
vending machine to deliver a flag.  The delivery is triggered by PUT request
with JSON data, such as `{ "amount":"4","item":"🍩"}`.  Probably replacing the
doughnut 🍩 with a flag should give the flag.

The hint points at JavaScript inheritance and a helpful tip on Discord was
`have a pro to type it in` which points towards prototype poisoning.  After
some playing around, changing the JSON to `{ {"__proto__": {"item":
"🚩"}, "amount":"1" } }` does yield the desired result
`{ お楽しみください 🚩 : he2022{p0llut10n_41nt_g00d} }`
