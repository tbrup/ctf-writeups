= [HE22.23] Dean's Transfers

image::level6/challenge23.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
Dean just launched his taxi business named Dean's Transfers.

For his website, he first wanted to register `deans-transfers.com`, 
but then found out there are so many fancy top-level domains out there. 
You found a service running on his server - find a flag there!

The service is running on port 2211 on 46.101.107.117.

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

=== Hint
Service fingerprinting.

== Solution

Service fingerprinting with `nmap` doesn't show any open ports, but
testing explicitly for port 2211 shows a result:

```
$ nmap -sV 46.101.107.117 -p 2211
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-04-10 11:55 CEST
Nmap scan report for 46.101.107.117
Host is up (0.021s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
2211/tcp open  domain  ISC BIND 9.11.5-P4-5.1+deb10u6 (Debian Linux)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 31.59 seconds
$ nmap -sV 46.101.107.117 -p 2211
```

So we have to find a way for it to spill some information.  The hint indicates
that Dean was baffled by the many top level domains, probably he found one that
fits him.  Get the list of all top-level domains at
https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt and try to see if we
can get a proper response from the DNS-server:

```
$ for tld in $(cat tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)
> do
> dig @46.101.107.117 -p 2211 $tld
> done | tee run2.out
```

For the domain `express` the reply is much longer, so we know that Dean
used the domain `deans-transports.express`.  Probably we are looking for
an unsecured DNS zone transfer so try this:
```
$ dig -t axfr deans-transfers.express. @46.101.107.117 -p 2211

The host with IP 10.0.0.8 looks suspicious, if its basename is base64-decoded we get the flag
`he2022{d34n_dr1v3s_you_3v3rywh3r3!!}`.
