\section{Intro}
We have detected C2 payloads on one of our servers! The blue team have
extracted its communications from the traffic logs, and Operations have dumped
the payload code from the running process.

Find out what the actors have exfiltrated!

\section{Solution}\label{hv22.24solution}

The payload shows that three values, $p$, $g$, $A$, are passed in, then a
random number $b$ is selected from the interval $(0,p]$ and then another value
$B = A^b \bmod p$ is calculated and returned.  From the log, we know the four
values and can calculate $b$, which is then used in the encryption of the
traffic.

There must be a simpler way, but I just bruteforced the constant $b$ and used
the result to decode the traffic.  The exchanged messages contain the flag and
all constants are:

\begin{verbatim}
p: 2272978429
g: 2
A: 1116819144
B: 1042188408
found b:  620620105

b'he2022{wh4dy4_m3an_32_b1t5_1s_1n53cur3}\n'
\end{verbatim}
