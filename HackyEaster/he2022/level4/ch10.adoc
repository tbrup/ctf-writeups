== Intro
My Irish friend told me about his new web site. He told me it was in a bucket
named egg-in-a-bucket. No clue what that is...

== Solution

The description hints at an AWS bucket named `egg-in-a-bucket` located in
Ireland.  It can be reached at
https://egg-in-a-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/index.html and shows a
nice picture with the flag `he2022{th1s_3gg_1s_1n_4_buck3t}`.
