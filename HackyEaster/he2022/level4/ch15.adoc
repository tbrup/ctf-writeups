== Intro
I got this hex dump, but I don't know what it is.

Any idea?

File: `leds.hex`

== Solution
The file is a variant of the Intel hex file format (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX).  On the second line a record type is
given as 0x0A, which seems to be used in the BBCMicro:bit computer.  At
https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor we can find an emulator that can show the
code as JavaScript code

input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    j += 0 - 1
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    basic.showString("" + (scribble(c)))
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    j += 5
})
function scribble (s: string) {
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - 1; i++) {
        r = "" + r + String.fromCharCode(s.charCodeAt(i) + j)
    }
    return r
}
let r = ""
let j = 0
let c = ""
c = "ZW$\"$$m`%&fQ^#ff^%QV%h#U%o"
----

So the characters in string c are shifted by an amount to print the flag.
Looking at c, we can make an educated guess that `$"$$` will be turned into
`2022` and thus a small python script prints the flag
`he2022{n34t_l1ttl3_d3v1c3}`.

----
s = ord('2') - ord('$')
flag = ''
for c in 'ZW$"$$m`%&fQ^#ff^%QV%h#U%o':
     flag += chr(ord(c)+s)
flag
