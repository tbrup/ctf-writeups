Snoopy dog found something interesting.

Can you get something interesting out of the 256 bytes he found?

```

== Solution
Googling for the keys in the file (<DOMAIN> etc) points us towards Citrix 
configuration files.  So the hash for the password is probably Citrix ctx1 
encoded.  https://cyberchef.org/ (CyberChef) has a recipe to decode 
the password, but complains about the wrong length.  Going the other way, 
starting with a password "he2022", shows a encoded password that starts 
with "MNGIKI...", so just add "MNG" to the front of the intercepted hash to 
get
`he2022{ctx1_41nt_3nKryp710n!}`.
