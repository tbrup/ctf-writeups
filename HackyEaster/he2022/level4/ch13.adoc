= [HE22.13] Statues

image::level4/challenge13.jpg[,300,float="right"]

== Intro
Hope you like statues as much as I do!

I created a little tour in my favourite city for you:

*    Richard I
*     Peter Pan
*     Albert
*     James Cook

I will not reveal my favourite statue, though. Find it yourself!

=== ðŸš© Flag

*    it's not the one on the challenge image (Joan of Arc)!
*    name of the person represented by the statue
*    all lowercase, no spaces, no special chars
*    e.g. `he2022{johnny}`

== Solution

The statues listed are all found in London, UK.  In Google Earth they are named

*    Statue of Richard I of England
*     Peter Pan Sculpture (by George Frampton)
*     The Albert Memorial
*     Captain James Cook Statue

When the locations are plotted on a map, the lines from Richard I to Peter Pan
and from Albert to James Cook cross near the statue for the Duke of Wellington.
The statue depicts Achilles, so the flag becomes 
`he2022{achilles}`.
