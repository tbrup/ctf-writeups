\subsection{Intro}
My Irish friend told me about his new web site. He told me it was in a bucket
named egg-in-a-bucket. No clue what that is...

\section{Solution}\label{hv21.10-solution}

The description hints at an AWS bucket named \verb+egg-in-a-bucket+ located in
Ireland.  It can be reached at
\url{https://egg-in-a-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/index.html} and shows a
nice picture with the flag \verb+he2022{th1s_3gg_1s_1n_4_buck3t}+.
